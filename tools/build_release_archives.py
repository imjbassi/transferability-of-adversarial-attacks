"""Build the anonymous TMLR supplement and the public experiment record.

The generated ZIP files are placed in ``release-assets/`` and intentionally
ignored by Git. Run this script from the repository root after the paper and
aggregate study artifacts have been regenerated.

Release invariant
-----------------
The manuscript and README cite Zenodo *concept* DOIs only and name the release
in prose ("the results reported here correspond to release vX.Y.Z"). Never cite
a version DOI: Zenodo mints it when the tag is archived, so no snapshot can
contain its own version DOI, and any that cites one permanently points at a
different snapshot than the one the reader is holding.

The prose version string is therefore a pointer that must be accurate at the
tagged commit. Any release that changes the paper must bump it in the *same*
commit that gets tagged -- ``paper/main.tex`` (Section "Evidence status and
limitations"), ``README.md`` (Citation), and ``version``/``date-released`` in
``CITATION.cff`` -- then tag that commit. Bumping after tagging reintroduces
exactly the mismatch this rule exists to prevent.

ANONYMOUS_README = """# Anonymous reproducibility supplement

This package accompanies the double-blind TMLR submission
"What transfer rates do not tell you: conditioning practice in adversarial
transfer evaluation."

Contents:
- `source/`: corrected implementation and tests;
- `artifacts/study/`: aggregate tables and figures used by the paper;
- `runs/`: per-example predictions, run summaries, and anonymized manifests;
- `training_records/`: seed-level training histories and anonymized metadata.

The per-example records cover every final evaluation reported in the paper.
Model checkpoint binaries are omitted to remain below the venue's 100 MB
supplement limit. Their SHA-256 hashes remain in the manifests, and the public
experiment-record archive will contain the binaries after double-blind review.

The manifests truthfully retain `git_dirty: true` from execution. Commit values
are redacted only for double-blind review; source-file and checkpoint hashes are
unchanged. See `source/pyproject.toml` for dependencies and run `pytest` from
`source/` to execute the test suite.
"""

PUBLIC_README = """# Experiment records

This archive contains the final experiment records for "What transfer rates do
not tell you: conditioning practice in adversarial transfer evaluation": aggregate study artifacts,
per-example predictions, manifests, training histories, and the eleven model
checkpoints used for the primary study and matched-learning-rate control.

The nine primary checkpoints cover ResNet-18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 at seeds
0, 1, and 2. Two additional seed-0 checkpoints support the matched-learning-rate
control. The recorded manifests truthfully report that execution occurred on a
dirty working tree and retain the executed-source hashes, checkpoint hashes,
prediction hashes, environment, and exact sample indices needed for audit.

The accompanying source release is archived separately under the project DOI.
The `survey/` directory contains the preregistered query, raw Semantic Scholar
response, 80-paper corpus, coding sheets, reliability calculation, and analytic
bounds.

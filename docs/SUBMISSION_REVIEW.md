# Submission readiness review

## Current status: survey revision is not submission-ready

The review below concerns the earlier CIFAR-10-focused manuscript, not a completed 80-paper survey. The current revision still requires the complete evidence audit, an actually blind reliability assessment, verified original-artifact recomputations where feasible, and a corpus-wide matched-population bounds assessment. The historical recode reused first-pass judgments and cannot support Cohen's kappa. Archived ImageNet ports are not yet validated original-configuration replications. See [survey status](../survey/README.md), [audit progress](../survey/evidence_audit/README.md), and [recomputation qualifications](../survey/recomputation/PROVENANCE.md). No release/DOI should present those unfinished analyses as complete.

## Earlier CIFAR-10 readiness review

The nine checkpoints, three full-test $L_\infty$ budget sweeps, and planned PGD convergence checks are complete. The empirical record supports a focused workshop paper about directionality, budget dependence, and source-success conditioning. Pilot measurements remain excluded from the manuscript.

## Defensible findings

- All models use CIFAR-10 labels, ten-class heads, differentiable in-model normalization, and raw-pixel perturbation budgets.
- Existing clean errors are excluded from PTR and CTR. Every per-run table prints exact numerators and denominators.
- Transfer is strongly directional and stable in ordering across three training seeds.
- Transfer changes substantially from $2/255$ to $8/255$.
- PTR and CTR separate most clearly when VGG16 source ASR is imperfect at $2/255$.
- The exact conditioning decomposition shows that the PTR--CTR gap is mostly explained by incomplete pairwise source success. The failed-source target-error term is small but nonzero for VGG16-sourced pairs, so CTR is not exactly derivable from conventional source ASR and PTR.
- Stronger PGD source optimization does not monotonically increase transfer for every direction.
- The primary 40-step/five-restart PGD result is close to the 100-step/five-restart endpoint, including the seed-0 $2/255$ check.
- A seed-0 control matching all initial learning rates at 0.01 preserves both large VGG transfer asymmetries. Individual entries remain optimization-sensitive, so this rules out a learning-rate-only explanation without establishing architecture-only causality.

These are descriptive results for the stated architectures, training procedures, and CIFAR-10 threat model. They do not establish architecture-only causality or general behavior across datasets and model families.

## Work remaining before submission

1. Select the workshop and replace the generic article layout with its official template. Check anonymity, page limit, deadline, artifact rules, and required assistance disclosure.
2. Freeze a clean release commit or tag. The completed manifests record `git_dirty: true`; retain their source-file hashes and archive the exact executed source snapshot.
3. Archive checkpoints, histories, manifests, per-example CSVs, generated tables, and commands outside Git if size requires it. Publish immutable checksums and a stable artifact link, such as a Zenodo DOI.
4. Have the author verify every manuscript number against the generated summary and confirm the contact address, coauthorship, acknowledgments, disclosure text, and repository license. The stated affiliation is Independent Researcher.

## Scientific limits reviewers may raise

- Three training seeds permit descriptive variability estimates but weak population-level inference.
- Only three conventional CNN families and one dataset are studied.
- VGG16 uses a validation-selected learning rate after the common recipe failed. A single-seed matched-learning-rate control addresses the simplest confound, but does not separate architecture from all optimization effects.
- Random-noise controls use separate deterministic draws for nominal source rows.
- The study does not include transformers, robust models, targeted attacks, AutoAttack, or an $L_2$ threat model.
- The contribution is measurement and reporting practice supported by a compact empirical case study, rather than a new attack or defense.

The strongest submission presents these limits directly and keeps the claim narrow: transfer rankings are conditional on direction, budget, source success, and the evaluated population.
